# Laptop Data Scraper: Best Buy

## Motivation
I'm on the hunt for a new laptop, and I would like an easy way to compare data between different options, but I don't wanna hand copy values from a page into a spreadsheet.

Using this script, I can print out a laptop's specifications into the console, copy it, and then paste it inside the sheet. Easy peasy!
